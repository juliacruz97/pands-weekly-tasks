# Remake a accounts.py program  that reads in a 10 character account number 
# and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing 
# (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs) Modifying the program to deal 
# with account numbers of any length (yes that is a vague requirement, 
# comment your assumptions).

account_number = (input('Please enter digit account number: '))
# Basically, this line of code allows the user to provide an account number
# by typing it into the console and stores this value in the 
# variable account_numberfor later use in the program.
# The user will enter the number of numbers without limits and will 
# show all the numbers entered because the limiter [0:10] 
# was not included in the programming line


print(account_number)
#I printed the quantity of numbers that was entered by the user
