# Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an
# approximation of its square root.

# n= int(input('Please input number: '))
# sqrt = n ** (1/2)
# print(sqrt)


x = float(input('imput the number to get your square root: '))
n = x*x
q = x**2 

sr= (n (n-2))
jsr = (2 * (n-2)**2)

print(sr)
